          <h2>The problem</h2>
		   <p class="lead">Parking enforcement officers spend hours walking, marking and managing the availability of parking spaces - a largely manual process. When cars are parking longer than the provisional time limits, officers would hand out infringement notices on the windscreens, however because of this they are often subjected to amounts of verbal and physical abuse.</p>

          <h2>The solution</h2>
          <p class="lead">In this project, I worked alongside 3 other students - Jacquie, Angie and Sandra. We propose Drones on Patrol (DOP) - a solution using autonomous drone technology used by parking officers through a mobile application. Drones are placed around defined bit areas to scan through license plates and monitor the occupation of parking spaces. DOP interacts with the drone to provide parking officers a live map of parking breach warnings, drone control and streamlined infringement issue and review. DOP aims to help manage arrays of parked cars more effectively and efficiently, with less room for error due to human factors.</p>

          <p>I played various roles during the design process including research, ideation, prototyping and user testing. The basic process was as follows:</p>

          <p>I conducted background research on current problems and technologies used to improve parking enforcement. Based on this we formed questions and conducted semi-structured interviews with parking enforcement personnel from local Sydney councils.</p>

              <li><strong>Safety</strong> - Physical and verbal abuse towards parking officers</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - Tiring, time-consuming with inconsistent results</li>
              <li><strong>Costly</strong> - Lack of resources and court cases has financial impact</li>

          <p>A big part of the design brief involved the facilitation of interaction between people and autonomous technology. Therefore, our design had to consider the incorporation of autonomous drones into improving the current parking enforcement system of the State. After ideating and testing a few design concepts, we decided to use the drone’s speed and monitoring capabilities through on-drone camera and GPS to patrol around assigned streets, similar to current camera cars which would be autonomous and therefore reduce the need to be on the road as well.</p>

          <p>An early design concept we had automated the entire patrolling process by distributing drones on routes and reviewing infringements in-office. This was discarded due to the impracticality of full automation, however we included some aspects of it in the form of "admin view", to give high-level users control and flexibility over use of the drones for patrolling.</p>

          <h4>Designing for outdoor daylight</h4>
          <p>Parking officers typically work in daylight hours, so we had to consider the contrast and readability of the app outdoors. This was done through multiple iterations of changes in the UI. By introducing white text on rich colours into the largely achromatic colour scheme, we aimed to heighten the contrast for better readability in bright sunlight. From feedback, increasing font-weight and sizes helped to make processing information easier for the user.</p>

          <h4>Creating a smooth user flow for efficiency</h4>
          <p>The swiping through the infringement notice was added based on early testing feedback. We took into consideration the interactions officers had with the current PDA for familiarity and ease of use and found their liked to swipe from right to left. Swiping allows officers to review the pre-filled information quicker in sections. In increasing font, we also had to add scrolling on some screens to look through the information where it used to be a fixed screen. Prompts and notifications of near parking breaches on app provide officers with faster information processing and task management so they can focus on where it's really needed.</p>

          <p>We evaluated with mainly two different stakeholders: parking enforcement and designers. Testing with parking officers gave us a lot of insight into the expectations and needs of officers if they were to use drones to automate some of their patrolling process. We used a combination of usability testing, heuristic evaluations and think-alouds to gain feedback on our concepts during testing, where I gave tasks and wrote notes on interactions and thoughts on the application. The majority of tests were done in-office and while they understood the purpose of testing, they often responded in terms of feasibility of the autonomous concept and were fairly satisfied with the user experience of the app. Therefore, the final prototype tests were done outdoors to test the screen visibility in sunlight and to give context. In improving our user interface, our studio tutor and other students helped in understanding aspects of interaction such as colour contrast and screen flows that should be considered.</p>

          <p>Our participants were satisfied with the design concept as it allowed them to more efficiently carry out their current duties through drone technology. Working on DOP, I realized the importance in user participation in the development process, especially in such a specialized field. More user testing could produce more targeted insights into ways to improve this concept further. I believe autonomous parking enforcement could potentially be made more effective in the future by automating more of the process to remedy the abuse caused by human interaction. It could be interesting to design the expectations of parking management from both councils and drivers, given the negative public perceptions towards current parking enforcement and uncertainty to drone surveillance concepts.</p>
