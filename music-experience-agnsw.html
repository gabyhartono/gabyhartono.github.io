          <h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Art galleries and museums are educational and inspirational institutions which receive many visitors hoping for a unique experience. For the unit DECO2014 User Experience, I collaborated with my group partner to explore the perceptions students had of the Art Gallery of NSW. From our research, we focused on the aspect of sound for student visitors to develop an app experience that would increase happiness and personalise gallery journeys through sound.</p>

          <h2>My role</h2>
          <span class="tagline">UX research, ideation, journey mapping</span>
          <p>I was involved in all phases of the project from user research to experience prototyping. My main responsibilities were to define the design brief and work on refining the user experience of the gallery journey.</p>

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>The goal of our research was to learn about the emotions visitors went through in their gallery journey. During our research, we incorporated a range of techniques from emphatic design. The use of these techniques are discussed below.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h3>Gallery walkthrough</h3>
          <p>The first step was to understand the gallery space itself and this was done in a gallery walkthrough. We journeyed through the gallery as visitors and documented the experience from the entrance through to the exhibitions through photographs. These were annotated with directions, decisions made and feelings at each point which resulted in a storyboard of our experience as visitors. The walkthrough was useful as a starting point to prepare our user research and to gain context about the gallery itself.</p>
          <h3>Generative Sessions</h3>
          <p>The main insights from user research came from data collected from generative sessions. These were small group workshops with interactive abstract exercises aimed to get participants to think about and share their individual gallery journeys. We had 6 participants, all students, who had visited the art gallery as we had easier access to them. Before each session, each participant was given a sensitising booklet prepared beforehand with small activities relating to their experiences for them to complete before their session. Similar to cultural probes, these help to give our participants an idea what to expect during the session. Our generative session involved collage activities with a like/dislike, past/present template regarding their idea of art galleries and a timeline for them to place emoji stickers of their most recent journey to the art gallery. These were discussed in a group interview to allow them to explain their collage expressions. </p>

          <h3>Statement Cards</h3>
          <p>We combined the use of statement cards and affinity diagramming as a quick way to analyse and gain insights from our research. Each of us looked through the notes and comments made from the generative sessions and sensitising booklets and wrote down points of interest on statement cards individually. These were grouped and titled with an overall statement the card communicated before we combined them as a group and clustered all our cards into similar themes. The resulting topics were then written on post-its and clustered using the affinity diagramming method with its overarching theme at the top for clarity.</p>

          <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-10">
          <p>After identifying problem areas using statement card affinity diagramming, we decided to focus on an aspect to improve – auditory experiences. The Art Gallery did offer audio guides for people with a disability, but it was notable that whilst not the core of the gallery experience, the sounds within the gallery affected our participants’ mood. Classical music was an expectation and a key point of interest for participants, and most felt that the noise from crowds of gallery visitors detracted from their experience.</p>
          <p>Given that some of our participants’ were students who went to galleries for the purpose of education and inspiration, we aimed for an improved auditory atmosphere to instil tranquillity and enhance the gallery as a learning environment.</p>

          <h2>Concept Development</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
			<div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-10">
          <p>To create our concepts we each thought of two different ideas and created a storyboard from it. They were then compared using a decision matrix based on criteria we thought was necessary and we chose the concept that we felt ticked the most important criteria as the central idea and added some aspects that worked in the others.</p>
          <p>The final concept was a mobile music app which played a curation of songs inspired or created from, the era or theme of the exhibition the user is currently in. For example, it would play classical music in the 18th century exhibition, and as users move into the 70’s it would transition to instrumental disco. As such, the music app would create a playlist based on artworks and places you visited within the gallery, which could be saved and allows people to request songs to improve the collection.</p>

					<span class="img-caption">Concept wireframes for the music app that I created. Users would have the opportunity to save the songs after they complete their visit and play it again on their next visit or start a new journey. It also features a recommendation feature if they didn't like what was played and the ability to end the journey at any time.</span>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h3>Refining the experience</h3>
          <p>Originally, the music journey would end in shared room experience where visitors could relax and explore others’ gallery journeys. This was later scrapped because it required additional space and was counterintuitive to the problems identified in our research. In refining our concept, I did further research in multisensory design, levels of engagement for app usage and aligned our target user needs to Reiss’ 16 basic motivations.</p>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>We envisioned that it would be possible with the implementation of iBeacons - an Apple technology standard utilising Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) emission from small objects called beacons. iBeacons allows for indoor location tracking so with the strategic placement of beacons near featured artworks and within exhibition spaces, events could be triggered within the music app with a Bluetooth-activated phone.</p>

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <p>Given that most perceive the gallery in a visual sense, people were intrigued by the AGNSW Music App concept. The ability to have a copy of the playlist even after the journey would create a nice token of your visit. However, it could be improved. This could include understanding where songs would be sourced from, what kinds of music are available or could be requested and the transitions moving from artwork to artwork to ensure a seamless experience which expands on the existing gallery collections.</p>
