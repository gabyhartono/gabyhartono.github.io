          <h2>The problem</h2>
		   <p class="lead">Parking enforcement officers spend hours walking, marking and managing the availability of parking spaces - a largely manual process. When cars are parking longer than the provisional time limits, officers would hand out infringement notices on the windscreens, however because of this they are often subjected to amounts of verbal and physical abuse.</p>

          <h2>The solution</h2>
          <p class="lead">In this project, I worked alongside Jacquie, Angie and Sandra to propose Drones on Patrol (DOP) - a solution using autonomous drone technology used by parking officers through a mobile application. Through a live map of parking breach warnings and drones and streamlined infringement issue and review, DOP aims to help manage arrays of parked cars more effectively and efficiently.</p>

          <p>I conducted background research on current problems and technologies used to improve parking enforcement. Based on this we formed questions and conducted semi-structured interviews with parking enforcement personnel from local Sydney councils.</p>
          <p><strong>The main problems were discovered:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Safety - Physical and verbal abuse towards parking officers</li>
              <li>Efficiency - Tiring, time-consuming with inconsistent results</li>
              <li>Costly - Lack of resources and court cases add up</li>

          <h4>Providing information in-line with government standards</h4>
          <p>It took us a few tries but after usability tests with several parking officers, we matched the information sectors our application provided to the terms used by parking officers in Sydney.</p>

          <h4>Streamlining parking management through drone-collected information</h4>
          <p>A big part of the design brief involved the facilitation of interaction between people and autonomous technology. Therefore, our design had to consider the incorporation autonomous drones into improving the current parking enforcement system of the State. After ideating and testing a few design concepts, we decided to use the droneâ€™s speed and monitoring capabilities through on-drone camera and GPS to patrol around assigned streets, similar to current camera cars which would be autonomous and therefore reduce the need to be on the road as well.</p>

          <h4>Designing for outdoor daylight</h4>
          <p>Parking officers typically work in daylight hours, so we had to consider the contrast and readability of the app outdoors. This was done through multiple iterations of changes in the UI. By introducing white text on rich colours into the largely achromatic colour scheme, we aimed to heighten the contrast for better readability in bright sunlight. From feedback, increasing font-weight and sizes helped to make processing information easier for the user.</p>

          <h4>Creating a smooth user flow for efficiency</h4>
          <p>The swiping through the infringement notice was added based on early testing feedback. We took into consideration the interactions officers had with the current PDA for familiarity and ease of use and found their liked to swipe from right to left. Swiping allows officers to review the pre-filled information quicker in sections. In increasing font, we also had to add scrolling on some screens to look through the information where it used to be a fixed screen. Prompts and notifications of near parking breaches on app provide officers with faster information processing and task management so they can focus on where they need to.</p>

          <p>Our participants were satisfied with the design concept as it allowed them to more efficiently carry out their current duties through drone technology. Working on DOP, I realized the importance in user participation in the development process, especially in such a specialized field. More user testing could produce more targeted insights into ways to improve this concept further. I believe autonomous parking enforcement could potentially be made more effective in the future by automating more of the process to remedy the abuse caused by human interaction. It could be interesting to design the expectations of parking management from both councils and drivers, given the negative public perceptions towards current parking enforcement and uncertainty to drone surveillance concepts.</p>
