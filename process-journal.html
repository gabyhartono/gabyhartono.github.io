                <p>In this DECO2200 Interaction Design Studio, I was tasked to improve on a problem area with the disruptive technology of autonomous vehicles by designing screen interaction. The overall project was done within a group of four, including myself, from user research to the production of an interactive prototype. Initially we started off looking into improving food delivery services but it changed into improving the efficiency and effectiveness of parking enforcement through autonomous drones. Through this unit, I have learnt more about the design thinking toolkit such as doing user research and communicating with potential users, and developed skills in prototyping tools. Below details the processes I went through throughout this project.</p>

                <p>To start off my research, I looked at the current autonomous technologies being used in the context of food delivery. I found that there were 2 main domains of technology used in food delivery implementation: small <strong>ground robots</strong> and <strong>drones</strong>.
                  The most notable example for these ground robots were <i>Starship Technologies</i> food delivery robots that were being tested in Silicon Valley in America. From this, I thought that ground robots were the most suitable for implementation in very near future, though there is more interest in research to delivery drones,
                  perhaps due to the prospect of making using of air space and avoiding all the ground traffic. For drones, I found that there was going to be a <i>Project Wing</i> trial done in a Tuggeranong in ACT, Australia. They've been testing small items and burritos delivery in the rural area but I think space problems could potentially occur in more populated areas.

                <p>For understanding current users of food delivery, I wanted to explore the current experience of food delivery and motivations for using. I sent out surveys and did a few interviews, as well as observed a street on campus where I often saw food delivery riders stopping by.</p>
				</p>The survey responses I got back were pretty similar but because I didn’t get as much responses from frequent users as I would have liked, it was hard to identify the problems. Most of the respondents were quite satisfied with the current service and were using food delivery services for the convenience of not having to cook. 
				My user research was not as thorough as I would have liked; I didn't get as much responses from current users but I did see a few trends. One thing that stood out to me was that people would be anxious if something went wrong with a delivery robot - therefore some felt that the current service was safer.</p>

                <p>Week 6:
                  <br>This week we were focusing on refining our problem space. Originally, we were looking at food delivery service in general and for busy students. But looking at longer, it felt a bit too broad and we couldn't really narrow down our scenario.</p>
                  <p>After talking with some tutors, we think there's an option to approach it from a business perspective, to prevent customer problems. Otherwise create the facilitator for interaction between restaurants and customers to food delivery robots like Uber or Airbnb.
                  Our user research doesn't quite reflect this though, and we don't have much connections to food businesses to fully understand their problems. I think that we should reframe our problem area and focus on a problem we are capable of solving but it's still very ambiguous.

                <p>Week 7:
                  <br>Worked on exploring our concepts and creating storyboards. We broadened the target area into creating a food delivery platform for university students and businesses and ideated two concepts:
                </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A mobile app for ordering, tracking and collecting food from autonomous delivery.</li>
                    <li>An in-built interface into the delivery robot to communicate to restaurant and customer delivery details and procedures with interaction with mobile app.</li>

                <p>
                  However, after discussions with tutors, it was decided that the problem area of food delivery too closely resembles existing services, and our concepts lacked to improve its efficiency. We had a change of plans and are now focused on background and user research into using autonomous technology for <strong>Parking Enforcement</strong>.

                <p>Week 8:
                  <br>With a new problem area - autonomous parking enforcement - and only a few weeks left to research and create concepts, we spent this week researching and planning. From reading journal and newspaper articles I got a sense of how parking officers managed parking spaces and issued infringement notices. Marking tyres with chalk was the traditional method though I did hear about use with license plate scanners though I couldn't find out how they worked. Parking officers also have a pretty negative public perception. They are seen as being unnecessarily harsh or the council's revenue raisers. In terms of technology, IOT use in parking enforcement has been implemented in Melbourne with sensors to increase effectiveness of parking officers. Based on this background research, I tried sketching some interface concepts for monitoring parking hours and cars that autonomous drones would survey. But I couldn't understand much of the views of the parking officers themselves; of who we were designing the interface for.

                  So for user research, we managed to get into contact with a few parking officials in councils through email. On Friday, I did a phone interview with a So for user research, we managed to get into contact with a few parking officials in councils through email. On Friday, I did a phone interview with a senior parking officer from Strathfield Council which gave us some insights into the working process of parking officers and the tools they currently use. We also happened upon two parking officers from City of Sydney on break and they helped us answer some of questions. They shared with us the experience and the abuse they get working as parking officers, included getting kicked and spat on. Our potential users were sceptical however, on the possibility of using drones for parking enforcement largely due to current government regulations and the loss of jobs.

                <p>Week 9: <br>
				We decided on two concepts – a mobile app for parking officers on patrol to find parking violations through drone surveys and a desktop application for managers in-office council to manage drone routes and infringement notices. </p>
				<p>I focused on sketching UI designs for concept 2, the desktop application. As another group member would also be thinking about alternate designs to concept 2, I thought back to our interviews, where the concern towards drones was the regulations surrounding it and how it would be able to scan from an aerial point of view. Therefore, for the low-fidelity prototype, I opted to use the idea of ground robots alike the food delivery ones from our earlier problem area to see if that was more reassuring, in a way. </p>
				<p>
				I figured to have a map of the patrolling areas as the main page. The map is colour coded by area and has icons for robots within that area. When you click on robots you'll be able to send them to another area, or any issues and violations they found within the area and pictures taken. Alternatively, if a sign of dispute, say the robot is vandalised, or something occurs you can manually take a picture from that robot. When you zoom in you'll be able to see individual parking spaces, parking provisions, etc. about parking. Parking violated cars will be marked, from license plate registration so even if they park somewhere else on the street, it will be fined. That being said, you can click on these marked cars to see the infringement notices they have been issued through e-permits if they enter the supervised areas. On the side is an expandable/minimizable sidebar of notices of violations, colour coded by area and symbol. Clicking on them will give infringement details available to print and mail out in a modal popup. Also, maybe an option could be included to cancel it if you find any errors. 
				That means the screens:
				<ol>
					<li>Map overview</li>
					<li>Interactivity with icons
						<ul>
							<li>cars, spaces</li>
							<li>robots</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Expanded sidebar</li>
					<li>Infringement details pop-up modal</li>
					<li>Login</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
				In the low fidelity paper prototype, I changed and omitted a couple of aspects from this early design such as the details seen when zooming and the expandable sidebar became a fixed and scrollable one. I wanted to make it a bit more simpler and some features were difficult to test with paper. At this point in time, I had an idea of what the parking manager wanted to achieve from this kind of concept, but I wasn’t entirely sure of what information they needed so in the end, the prototype was focused on testing the overall interface elements of clicking robots and finding infringements.

                <p>Some things I would like to explore/change after today's first user testing:
				<ul>
					<li>drone setting options. Instead of drop down to area, drag and drop, highlight might be more intuitive. Also set time and schedule for 	routing.</li>
					<li>information-wise, do officers get what they need to know?</li>
					<li>naming, for example, cancel and review</li>
					<li>area creation, explanation on areas</li>
