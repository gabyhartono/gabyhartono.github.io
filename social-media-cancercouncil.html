          <h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>Cancer Council Australia is Australia's biggest charity organisation dedicated to funding research and bringing awareness towards a cancer-free future. I researched Cancer Council as part of my social media strategy project, where I worked with my colleague to devise a strategy to increase youth engagement with Cancer Council's social media channels. In addition, we also designed a WordPress site to act as the content hub to supplement the proposed strategy.</p>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-9">
					<p>To begin we started off by doing research of the health organisation and its social media channels. We conducted online ethnography focusing on three of their social media channels: Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This involved collecting content from their past posts, comments, replies and taking note of themes and personality. We also used a social media analysis tool called Socialbakers to monitor reach and engagement metrics. We also used big data tools such as Similar Web and Google Trends to understand site traffic and common topics related to cancer on the web.</p>
          <p>From this, it was found that their Facebook community valued knowledge of their services, health education, diversity. There were also several enquiries about Cancer Council sun protection products. On Twitter, followers liked to hear about support services, international cancer events, inspirational stories and government-related news. Instagram being a image-focused channel showed a higher appreciation for infographics and posts regarding diversity and community.</p>

			<div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Due to the lack of youth presence on Cancer Council social media, we wanted to focus on increasing engagement with teens and young adults in the 16-25 age group. Since most of the demographic is online using the existing social media platforms, this would allow a further reach throughout the online community and help get people involved in fundraising events.</p>
          <p>To do this, we saw three main post types needed: <strong>Images, Videos and Informational Links</strong></p>
          <p>In our research these types of posts had more interactions (as likes, comments or shares) and were capable of capturing attention and conveying information succinctly. From this I created a content pillar chart to document what kinds of content - be it inspirational, educational, or event-based - should be used in their social media and how it would be distributed.</p>

          <h2>WordPress Website</h2>

      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>The WordPress website acted as the content hub for posts from our social media strategy. We chose to go with a clean, minimalist theme to go with the white and yellow of their brand colours, in line with the seriousness of the subject but with a friendly interface to convey the support the organisation gives in turn. The image of a yellow flower that reminds of the daffodil used in their logo, symbolising hope, which was used in the landing page's hero.</p>

          <p>The strategy and WordPress website was received well through the feedback given. While we were unable to test the actual strategy due to the restraints of the project scope, the social media analytics tools used and the WordPress analytics dashboard would have been helpful in measuring the success of the proposed strategy. I learnt about ways social media campaigns can be impactful and how certain content can be more engaging to an online audience.</p>
