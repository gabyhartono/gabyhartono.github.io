          <h2>The problem</h2>
  		   <p>The University of Sydney Camperdown campus is a place where many students walk to their classes and transport stops every day. As such, the university needs an effective and efficient solution for students to easily find routes and public transport to get from campus to its surrounds. For this unit DECO1008 Design Processes and Methods project, I worked in a group of three to research, develop and test a wayfinding solution for University of Sydney students.</p>

        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>We conducted contextual observation in the Cadigal Green area and City Road as they were popular channels taken by students to the main campus and transport stops. I took images for contextual observation three days across two weeks, to get a sense of the paths and actions of students during different times and weather conditions. We also conducted interviews and distributed questionnaires to understand the needs and issues of University of Sydney students. We each synthesised the information and combined our analysis together to discover that people found campus signage poor and most have resorted to digital wayfinding mobile applications like Google Maps to travel to and from campus.</p>
          <p>Personas such as the one below were created based on the research to visualise the goals and issues faced by our target demographic.</p>

          <p>Considering the needs of our personas, we aimed to conceptualise physical, digital wayfinding systems. I drew sketches of our concepts in an iterative process and focused on a sheltered station inspired by shopping mall kiosks and with an interface similar to map applications. This was prototyped out of cardboard to test the aesthetic and functional aspects of the wayfinding station.  We underwent multiple persona-based walkthroughs, usability tests and evaluations to decide on the features to implement into the solution and features to remove or improve.</p>

          <p>The final design of the project was well-received by my tutor and my peers. In our user evaluations, students found the interface intuitive and user-friendly and liked the sense of privacy a sheltered station would give. That being said, voiced direction was seen as a counter to the privacy aspect, so the option to mute may be appropriate were it to be implemented.</p>
          <p>As a student, this project enabled me to learn about the iterative nature of the design process and discuss solutions with my group. As one of my first university projects, it helped me to understand the importance of design thinking and user testing.</p>
