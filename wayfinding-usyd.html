          <h2>Overview</h2>
  		   <p>The University of Sydney Camperdown campus is a place where many students walk to their classes and transport stops every day. As such, the university needs an effective and efficient solution for students to easily find routes and public transport to get from campus to its surrounds. For this unit DECO1008 Design Processes and Methods project, I worked in a group to research, develop and test a wayfinding solution for University of Sydney students. Our final concept was a sheltered wayfinding station where university visitors could look up places and transport stops on a touchscreen map interface.</p>

          <p>We wanted to learn more about how students travelled around campus. So we conducted contextual observation in the Cadigal Green area and City Road as they were popular channels taken by students to the main campus and transport stops. I took images for contextual observation on three days across two weeks, to get a sense of the paths and actions of students during different times and weather conditions. We also conducted structured interviews and distributed questionnaires to understand the needs and issues of University of Sydney students.</p>
          <img src="img/portfolio/usyd-wayfinding-design/Superimposed_shot.jpg" class="img-fluid" />
          <p>Data from the observations and qualitative answers were synthesised individually using the affinity diagramming method and combined together to discover that people found campus signage poor and most have resorted to digital wayfinding mobile applications like Google Maps to travel to and from campus. People also tended to follow crowds instead of asking for directions, since being, as well as looking, lost was a frustrating experience.</p>
          <p>Personas such as the one below were created based on the research to visualise the goals and issues faced by our target demographic.</p>

          <p>Considering the needs of our personas, we aimed to conceptualise physical, digital wayfinding systems. I drew sketches of our concepts in an iterative process informed by our group design critiques, before focusing on a sheltered station inspired by shopping mall kiosks and with an interface similar to map applications.</p>

          <p>The station was prototyped out of cardboard and paper to test the aesthetic and ergonomic structure of the design. A member of the group created a screen prototype of the wayfinding function of the touchscreen which was used to test the interface and ease of finding ways to either a place or transport stop. Using these, we underwent multiple persona-based walkthroughs, usability tests and evaluations to decide on the features to implement into the solution and features to remove or improve.</p>

      			<li><strong>Curved shelter</strong> for rain protection and privacy. The shelter provides overhead cover and protection of the touchscreen during rain.</li>
      			<li><strong>Digital touchscreen</strong> for ease-of-use.</li>
      			<li><strong>User-friendly interface</strong> similar to map apps, featuring distance radii according to walk times.</li>
      			<li><strong>Separate keyboard</strong> for ergonomic comfort.</li>
      			<li><strong>Voice-enabled</strong> direction for accessibility.</li>
      			<li><strong>QR code</strong> for portability. Users can download the directions received from their search onto their phone to use as reference on their way.</li>

          <p>The final design of the project was well-received. In our user evaluations, students found the interface intuitive and user-friendly and liked the sense of privacy a sheltered station would give. That being said, voiced direction was seen as a counter to the privacy aspect, so the option to mute may be appropriate were it to be implemented.</p>
          <p>As a student, this project enabled me to learn about the iterative nature of the design process and discuss solutions with my group. As one of my first university projects, it helped me to understand the importance of design thinking and user testing.</p>
